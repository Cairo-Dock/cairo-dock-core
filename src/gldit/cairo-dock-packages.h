/**@file cairo-dock-packages.h This class provides a convenient way to deal with packages. A Package is a tarball (tar.gz) of a folder, located on a distant server, that can be installed locally.
* Packages are listed on the server in a file named "list.conf". It's a group-key file starting with "#!CD" on the first line; each package is described in its own group. Packages are stored on the server in a folder that has the same name, and contains the tarball, a "readme" file, and a "preview" file.
*
* The class offers a high level of abstraction that allows to manipulate packages without having to care their location, version, etc.
* It also provides convenient utility functions to download a file or make a request to a server.
*
* To get the list of available packages, use \ref cairo_dock_list_packages, or its asynchronous version \ref cairo_dock_list_packages_async.
* To access a package, use \ref cairo_dock_get_package_path.
