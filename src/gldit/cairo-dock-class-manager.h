*@struct GldiAppInfo Helper object for launching apps, wrapping a GAppInfo.

* 
* GldiAppInfo derives from GlidObject, so you should use gldi_object_ref () /
* gldi_object_unref () to manage its lifecycle.
* 
* Note: currently, the class-manager automatically creates a GldiAppInfo
* for all apps registered with it, filling out the corresponding icon's
* pAppInfo member as it is created, so there is no need to create this
* object manually. A constructor is provided only to create a GldiAppInfo
* wrapping a custom commnad to run.

* @return the class ID in a newly allocated string (can be used to retrieve class properties later).
* 
* The cSearchTerm supplied to this function should be either:
*  - a desktop file path which is opened if it exists; if not, the file basename is searched among the
*    desktop IDs of installed apps in a case-insensitive way, but no other heuristics is attempted
*  - a desktop file ID (i.e. a string not starting with "/" and ending with ".desktop"); it is searched
*    among the desktop IDs of installed apps (case-insensitive); if not found, a heuristic search is
*    also attempted
*  - a class name / app-id (from the StartupWMClass key of a launcher) or a command name; this is assumed
*    to be already lowercase, and it is searched among installed apps using heuristics
* 
* Heuristics applied to search are the following:
*  - search among desktop file IDs by applying common suffices (org.gnome., org.kde., org.freedesktop)
*  - duplicating the name (e.g. "firefox" -> "firefox_firefox.desktop", required for Snap)
*  - searching the content of the StartupWMClass or the Exec key (if StartupWMClass is not present)
*    in the .desktop file
* 
* The cWmClass parameter is not used for searching among installed apps, but it is added without any
* modification as an additional key for this class for later retrieval (so it is useful if the app
* uses a WMClass / app-id that is not possible to find with our heuristics).
* 
* The bCreateAlways controls whether cSearchTerm is always used to create a class:
*  - if bCreateAlways == FALSE, and no result is found, no class is created and NULL is returned
*  - if bCreateAlways == TRUE, and an app is found, a class is created as normal, but it is also ensured
*    that cSearchTerm is added as a key for retrieval (in this case, the return value will be cSearchTerm)
*  - if bCreateAlways == TRUE, and no result is found, a "dummy" class is created and registered; this
*    should be used as a last resort to ensure that a launcher has a class registered
*  - if bIsDesktopFile == TRUE, cSearchTerm is assumed to be the name of a .desktop file and is processed accordingly
*    (the .desktop suffix removed and converted to lowercase)
