  <description summary="describe and manage toplevel state">
    The purpose of the interfaces in this protocol is to describe
    and potentially allow management of the state of a foreign toplevel.

    This protocol depends on the ext-foreign-toplevel-list protocol.

    The compositor may choose to restrict this protocol to a special client
    launched by the compositor itself or expose it to all clients,
    this is compositor policy.

    The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
    "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        This event advertises the capabilities supported by the compositor. If

        Compositors must send this event once after creation of an
        ext_foreign_toplevel_state_v1. When the capabilities change, compositors
        must send this event again.
